description
The Random Result Calculator is a fun and playful tool that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, instead of showing you the actual result of the calculation, it provides a random result every time. You simply enter two numbers and choose an operation. The calculator then does the calculation in the background but displays a randomly generated number within a specified range instead. This tool is great for adding a bit of unpredictability to your math activities and can be a fun way to engage with numbers without focusing on the actual calculations.
problem
Imagine you’re doing a bit of math: you carefully enter two numbers into a calculator, pick an operation, and hit "equals." But instead of getting the answer you expect, the calculator tosses you a random number! You thought you’d find out how much 7 + 5 is, but nope—this quirky calculator tells you it’s 23, or maybe 1, or perhaps -4. 
This calculator has a mind of its own and refuses to give the real answer, ever. It’s like a magic 8-ball for arithmetic, injecting a bit of mystery and chaos into math by deliberately “getting it wrong” every single time. Perfect for those moments when you don’t want to take math too seriously!
solution-
Here’s how we’ll make this mischievous calculator work!
Take the Numbers: You enter two numbers, thinking you're in for a regular calculation.
Choose the Operation: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division—pick your poison!
Do the Math (Secretly): Behind the scenes, the calculator performs the actual math operation... but don’t expect it to share the truth with you!
Generate a Random Result: Instead of showing you the real answer, it picks a random number in a range we’ve set up (maybe close, maybe way off—who knows?!).
Reveal the Mystery Answer: The calculator confidently displays a totally random result, leaving you wondering if it’s even close.
